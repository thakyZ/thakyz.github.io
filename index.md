## About

Hi I am Nick "Neko Boi" ***REMOVED***. I am a 22 year old programmer from ***REMOVED*** in the United States. I have recently been working on a lot of mods for different games, and some applications like tools and utilities for daily use on the a computer.   
I have a background in Linux server administration and I have a rather large background with programming in C# and have gone to school for Video Game Design and Programming, at ***REMOVED*** Tech Skills Center, in ***REMOVED***, ***REMOVED***.
